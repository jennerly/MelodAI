This is due to the inverse trend of decreasing decibels and increasing frequency in comparison to pink noise. With that being said, this creates an effect of heavy rain. This can be beneficial to sleep or ear ringing as it has a grainier effect. It has al been proven that it can help with cognitive function and focus."
